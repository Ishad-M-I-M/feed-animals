# Project Description

Use react to create a page for a zoo.
It should be possible to feed the animals:) 
A list of animals is available at: https://animals.azurewebsites.net/api/animals 
You need to download the animals to your application and save them in the application. It will not be possible to change the animals via the api. It is suggested that you store them in localStorage or sessionStorage.

For the project: 
* Create a SPA (in react with typescript) that contains a start page where the animals are presented with a name and a short description. 

* It should be possible to click on an animal to see more information about this animals via a separate route. 

* From the animal's own page, you should be able to mark whether the animal is now fed or not via a button called Feed animals. When you click on this button, the status of the animal must change so that it appears that it has been fed. And it should no longer be possible to click the button. You also need to add in the time the animal was fed. 

* Your code must follow best practice in terms of naming and commenting. three hours since the last feeding. If this is the case, the feeding is reset and it should be possible to feed the animal again. 

* For a little extra challenge, you must present a small notice on the start page, as well as on the animal side, that an animal needs to be fed if it is more than four hours

* Your code should be very well structured and in cases where you can not, optimize the code by making it more compact than it was before.

* Use stylized components.
